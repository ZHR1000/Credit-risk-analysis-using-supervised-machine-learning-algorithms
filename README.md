# Credit-risk-analysis-using-supervised-machine-learning-algorithms

Overview: Credit risk refers to the threat associated with a borrower's capacity to repay a loan as well 
as the interest rate charged. The borrower can be a person or business. Banks can maximize profits by 
giving credit to just those borrowers who are most likely to repay their debts while reducing losses by 
not providing credit to those who are likely to fail on their loans.

Problem Statement: Building a model to estimate how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan, 
with the goal of only approving loans for those who are most likely to repay them. We want to be very 
certain when we categorize someone as a non-defaulter as the cost of making a mistake might be 
quite costly to organizations. 

Approach: the project retained following algorithms
▪ Logistic Regression
▪ Decision Tree
▪ Random Forest
▪ Extreme Gradient Boosting Model

The project also mainly highlights that it's critical to check data quality (by excluding redundant 
variables during the preparation and cleaning phase) and to deal with an imbalanced training dataset 
to avoid bias in majority class. We shall also indicate that the features chosen to meet the business 
objective (Can we make this decision with only a few features to save time?) and the algorithm applied 
to make the decision (whether the borrower defaults or not) are two important keys in the decision 
management processing when issuing a loan (in this case, the bank).

Pre-requisites:
1) Python
2) Jupyter Notebook
