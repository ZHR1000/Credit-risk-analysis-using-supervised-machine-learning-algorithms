# Credit-risk-analysis-using-supervised-machine-learning-algorithms

Overview: Credit risk refers to the threat associated with a borrower's capacity to repay a loan as well 
as the interest rate charged. The borrower can be a person or business. Banks can maximize profits by 
giving credit to just those borrowers who are most likely to repay their debts while reducing losses by 
not providing credit to those who are likely to fail on their loans.

Problem Statement:  With the emergence of the digitization of housing finance in India, 
the home loan market is experiencing an enormous opportunity due to increasing internet and smartphone penetration. 
Consequently, the home loan market grew nearly 30% between 2016 to 2021, adding to the increased possibility of credit risk.
Thus, the project aims to utilize advanced ML techniques to predict credit defaulters for financial
institutions and identify the right customers given their credit histories and improve profitability.
 

Approach: the project retained following algorithms
▪ Logistic Regression
▪ Decision Tree
▪ Random Forest
▪ Extreme Gradient Boosting Model

The project also mainly highlights that it's critical to check data quality (by excluding redundant 
variables during the preparation and cleaning phase) and to deal with an imbalanced training dataset 
to avoid bias in majority class. We shall also indicate that the features chosen to meet the business 
objective (Can we make this decision with only a few features to save time?) and the algorithm applied 
to make the decision (whether the borrower defaults or not) are two important keys in the decision 
management processing when issuing a loan (in this case, the bank).

Pre-requisites:
1) Python
2) Jupyter Notebook
